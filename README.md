## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got an overall review of html and css and could apply my knowledge. I learned how to center a container, stops overflowing an image and the usage of classes in the stylesheet

### Continued development

I realised that I needed more practise using css, being familiarised with common attributes and page settings. I was stuck in centering the container as I had only a primary knowledge of flexbox. I understood the need of more practise in using flexbox.
